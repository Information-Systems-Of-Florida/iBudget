%The Florida Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD) iBudget algorithm, currently implemented as Model 5b, operates under a complex regulatory framework that severely constrains potential replacement methodologies. The algorithm must comply with Florida Statute 393.0662, Florida Administrative Code 65G-4.0214, and House Bill 1103's explainability requirements, while maintaining deterministic single-point budget allocations that can withstand appeals processes.

%The current Model 5b uses 22 QSI predictors with square-root transformation, achieving $R^2$ = 0.7998 and BIC = 159,394.3 on 26,625 consumers. Any replacement must meet or exceed this performance while maintaining complete transparency in decision-making logic. The regulatory framework explicitly prohibits black-box models, probabilistic outputs, and any methodology that cannot provide clear, interpretable explanations for individual budget determinations.

%The 10 alternative methods presented here span four regulatory compliance tiers, from immediate deployment candidates to advanced research methods requiring fundamental framework changes. Each model documentation follows the comprehensive template structure, addressing algorithm specification, accuracy metrics, robustness analysis, implementation feasibility, and regulatory alignment.

\section{Summary of Alternative APD iBudget Methods}

\subsection{Executive Overview}

The Florida Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD) iBudget algorithm, currently implemented as Model 5b, requires modernization while maintaining strict regulatory compliance. This analysis presents ten alternative methods organized into four tiers based on regulatory feasibility, ranging from immediately deployable solutions to advanced research methods. Each alternative has been evaluated against Florida Statute 393.0662, Florida Administrative Code 65G-4.0214, and House Bill 1103's explainability requirements.

The current Model 5b achieves an R-squared of 0.7998 using 22 QSI predictors with square-root transformation, but excludes 9.4 percent of consumers as outliers. Any replacement must meet or exceed this performance while providing deterministic, single-point budget allocations that can withstand appeals processes. The alternatives presented here offer various trade-offs between statistical sophistication, implementation complexity, and regulatory compliance.

\subsection{Tier 1: Direct Replacement Candidates}

\textbf{Model 1: Re-estimated Linear Regression} maintains the exact Model 5b structure while updating coefficients with current data. This represents the safest implementation path with zero regulatory risk. Performance improves marginally to R-squared of 0.8012, with implementation possible within 2 weeks. The primary advantage is complete regulatory compliance with minimal stakeholder disruption. However, it retains the problematic 9.4 percent outlier exclusion requirement.

\textbf{Model 2: Generalized Linear Model with Gamma Distribution} replaces square-root transformation with a log-link function, naturally accommodating right-skewed expenditure data. This approach eliminates back-transformation bias and achieves R-squared of 0.8145. The Gamma distribution handles outliers naturally without exclusions. Implementation requires 6-12 months including regulatory rule updates to specify the link function. The multiplicative interpretation of coefficients aligns well with percentage-based budget discussions.

\textbf{Model 3: Robust Linear Regression using Huber M-Estimators} represents the optimal balance between innovation and compliance. It includes ALL consumers through automatic outlier downweighting rather than exclusion. Each consumer receives a weight between 0 and 1 indicating data quality. Performance reaches R-squared of 0.8023 while improving fairness. The transparent weight system enhances rather than complicates the appeals process. Implementation requires 6 months with moderate training requirements.

\subsection{Tier 2: Conditional Replacement Candidates}

\textbf{Model 4: Weighted Least Squares} addresses heteroscedasticity through variance-based weighting, achieving R-squared of 0.8089. However, significant equity concerns arise as weights could create systematic bias across demographic groups. Implementation requires 12-18 months with extensive fairness testing and continuous monitoring. The approach offers superior efficiency for stable cases but may disadvantage high-need consumers with variable costs.

\textbf{Model 5: Ridge Regression} applies L2 regularization to handle multicollinearity among QSI variables. While offering the highest stability and reducing condition numbers from 45.6 to 8.2, the shrinkage concept proves difficult to explain to non-technical audiences. Performance slightly decreases to R-squared of 0.7956, but generalization improves. The requirement to retain all 22 predictors aligns with current regulations, though penalty parameter justification remains challenging.

\textbf{Model 6: Log-Normal Regression} uses natural log transformation, which Box-Cox analysis indicates as superior to square-root. Achieving R-squared of 0.8067, it provides intuitive percentage-change interpretations. However, regulatory approval requires definitive statistical evidence of superiority over the current transformation. Retransformation bias must be carefully managed using smearing estimators or parametric corrections.

\subsection{Tier 3: Research and Validation Methods}

\textbf{Model 7: Quantile Regression} models multiple percentiles of the expenditure distribution rather than just the mean. While providing valuable insights into allocation uncertainty and risk stratification, it fatally violates F.S. 393.0662's requirement for a single deterministic allocation. The method cannot produce the required point estimate for budgeting but offers excellent research value for understanding consumer variability and supporting appeals with uncertainty estimates.

\textbf{Model 8: Bayesian Linear Regression} treats all parameters as probability distributions, providing complete uncertainty quantification through posterior distributions and credible intervals. Despite strong statistical foundations and natural handling of missing data, Medicaid's requirement for deterministic budgets makes this approach legally impossible. The probabilistic output fundamentally conflicts with statutory requirements for fixed allocation amounts.

\subsection{Tier 4: Advanced Methods Requiring Framework Changes}

\textbf{Model 9: Principal Components Regression} transforms correlated QSI variables into orthogonal components, reducing dimensionality from 22 to 7-8 principal components. However, the transformation destroys the required direct relationship between individual QSI questions and budget allocations. Abstract linear combinations cannot be explained in appeals processes, violating F.A.C. 65G-4.0214's requirement for interpretable coefficients. The method fundamentally fails transparency requirements despite handling multicollinearity effectively.

\textbf{Model 10: Deep Learning Neural Network} achieves the highest accuracy with R-squared of 0.8456 through multiple hidden layers capturing complex non-linear relationships. However, neural networks epitomize the black-box algorithms explicitly prohibited by HB 1103. With 4,049 parameters interacting non-linearly, no meaningful explanation of individual decisions is possible. Implementation would trigger immediate legal challenges and violate due process requirements. The complete lack of interpretability makes appeals impossible and public trust unsustainable.

\subsection{Implementation Recommendations}

Based on comprehensive analysis, we recommend a phased implementation approach beginning with Tier 1 methods. Model 3 (Robust Linear Regression) offers the optimal balance of innovation and compliance, addressing the critical outlier exclusion issue while maintaining full interpretability. For immediate deployment with minimal risk, Model 1 (Re-estimation) provides a baseline improvement. Model 2 (Gamma GLM) should be developed in parallel as a medium-term enhancement.

Tier 2 methods warrant careful pilot testing, particularly Model 6 (Log-Normal) which shows statistical merit. However, Model 4 (Weighted LS) poses unacceptable equity risks despite efficiency gains. Ridge Regression offers stability benefits but faces explainability challenges that may prove insurmountable.

Tier 3 methods should be implemented exclusively for research and validation purposes. Both Quantile and Bayesian approaches provide valuable uncertainty quantification for policy analysis and appeals support but cannot generate required deterministic allocations. Their insights should inform risk management and reserve planning without directly determining budgets.

Tier 4 methods must be categorically rejected for iBudget allocation. Both PCR and neural networks fundamentally violate transparency requirements and would trigger immediate legal challenges. While neural networks achieve superior accuracy, the black-box nature directly contradicts HB 1103's explainability mandate. These methods serve only to establish theoretical performance ceilings.

\subsection{Conclusion}

The path forward requires balancing statistical sophistication with regulatory constraints and stakeholder acceptance. Robust Linear Regression emerges as the recommended solution, eliminating problematic outlier exclusions while maintaining the transparency essential for public programs serving vulnerable populations. Success depends on careful implementation with extensive stakeholder engagement, comprehensive training programs, and continuous monitoring for fairness and equity. The transition from Model 5b must prioritize continuity of service while achieving measurable improvements in accuracy, fairness, and inclusivity.
