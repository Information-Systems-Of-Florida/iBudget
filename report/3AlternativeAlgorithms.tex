The Florida Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD) iBudget algorithm, currently implemented as Model 5b, operates under a complex regulatory framework that severely constrains potential replacement methodologies. The algorithm must comply with Florida Statute 393.0662, Florida Administrative Code 65G-4.0214, and House Bill 1103's explainability requirements, while maintaining deterministic single-point budget allocations that can withstand appeals processes.

The current Model 5b uses 22 QSI predictors with square-root transformation, achieving $R^2$ = 0.7998 and BIC = 159,394.3 on 26,625 consumers. Any replacement must meet or exceed this performance while maintaining complete transparency in decision-making logic. The regulatory framework explicitly prohibits black-box models, probabilistic outputs, and any methodology that cannot provide clear, interpretable explanations for individual budget determinations.

The 10 alternative methods presented here span four regulatory compliance tiers, from immediate deployment candidates to advanced research methods requiring fundamental framework changes. Each model documentation follows the comprehensive template structure, addressing algorithm specification, accuracy metrics, robustness analysis, implementation feasibility, and regulatory alignment.






 \section{Summary of Alternative APD iBudget Methods}

 \subsection{Executive Overview}

 The Florida Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD) iBudget algorithm, currently implemented as Model 5b, requires modernization while maintaining strict regulatory compliance. This analysis presents ten alternative methods organized into four tiers based on regulatory feasibility, ranging from immediately deployable solutions to advanced research methods. Each alternative has been evaluated against Florida Statute 393.0662, Florida Administrative Code 65G-4.0214, and House Bill 1103's explainability requirements.

The current Model 5b achieves an R-squared of 0.7998 using 22 QSI predictors with square-root transformation, but excludes 9.4 percent of consumers as outliers. Any replacement must meet or exceed this performance while providing deterministic, single-point budget allocations that can withstand appeals processes. The alternatives presented here offer various trade-offs between statistical sophistication, implementation complexity, and regulatory compliance.

\section{Model Summary}

\subsection{Algorithm Selection Rationale}

The following section provides a concise justification for each of the 10 algorithms evaluated in this study. Each model was selected to address specific challenges in the iBudget allocation system or to establish performance benchmarks.

HB 1103  requires to ``develop alternative algorithms using multiple linear regression" (lines 689-690). The algorithms must be tested for "accuracy and reliability" (lines 690-691). The focus is specifically on "multiple linear regression models" (line 681). The requirement for multiple linear regression inherently means the algorithm must be interpretable and explainable, as linear regression models provide clear coefficients that show how each input affects the output.

\subsubsection{Model 1: Re-estimated Linear Regression}
\textbf{Why chosen}: Maintains exact Model 5b structure while updating coefficients with current data. Represents the safest implementation path with zero regulatory risk.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete regulatory compliance with minimal stakeholder disruption
    \item Implementation possible within 2 weeks
    \item Retains problematic 9.4\% outlier exclusion requirement
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model 2: Generalized Linear Model with Gamma Distribution}
\textbf{Why chosen}: Replaces square-root transformation with log-link function, naturally accommodating right-skewed expenditure data without back-transformation bias.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gamma distribution handles outliers naturally without exclusions
    \item Multiplicative interpretation aligns with percentage-based budget discussions
    \item Implementation requires 6-12 months including regulatory rule updates
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model 3: Robust Linear Regression using Huber M-Estimators}
\textbf{Why chosen}: Represents optimal balance between innovation and compliance. Includes ALL consumers through automatic outlier downweighting rather than exclusion.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each consumer receives weight between 0 and 1 indicating data quality
    \item Transparent weight system enhances appeals process
    \item Implementation requires 6 months with moderate training requirements
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model 4: Weighted Least Squares}
\textbf{Why chosen}: Addresses heteroscedasticity through variance-based weighting. Offers superior efficiency for stable cases but raises equity concerns.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Weights could create systematic bias across demographic groups
    \item Implementation requires 12-18 months with extensive fairness testing
    \item May disadvantage high-need consumers with variable costs
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model 5: Ridge Regression}
\textbf{Why chosen}: Applies L2 regularization to handle multicollinearity among QSI variables. Offers highest stability despite communication challenges.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduces condition numbers from 45.6 to 8.2
    \item Requirement to retain all 22 predictors aligns with current regulations
    \item Shrinkage concept proves difficult to explain to non-technical audiences
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model 6: Log-Normal Regression}
\textbf{Why chosen}: Uses natural log transformation supported by Box-Cox analysis. Provides intuitive percentage-change interpretations.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Superior statistical foundation compared to square-root transformation
    \item Requires definitive statistical evidence for regulatory approval
    \item Retransformation bias managed using smearing estimators
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model 7: Quantile Regression}
\textbf{Why chosen}: Models multiple percentiles of expenditure distribution for research insights. Cannot produce required point estimates for production use.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provides valuable understanding of allocation uncertainty
    \item Excellent for risk stratification and appeals support
    \item Fatally violates F.S. 393.0662's requirement for single deterministic allocation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model 8: Bayesian Linear Regression}
\textbf{Why chosen}: Treats parameters as probability distributions, providing complete uncertainty quantification through posterior distributions and credible intervals.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Natural handling of missing data and parameter uncertainty
    \item Probabilistic output conflicts with Medicaid's deterministic budget requirements
    \item Legally uncertain despite strong statistical foundations
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model 9: Random Forest}
\textbf{Why chosen}: Ensemble of decision trees captures non-linear relationships without parametric assumptions. Creates interpretability challenges for regulatory compliance.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Aggregates predictions from multiple trees built on bootstrap samples
    \item Variable importance scores indicate contribution but lack direct coefficients
    \item Violates F.A.C. 65G-4.0214's requirement for interpretable coefficients
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model 10: Deep Learning Neural Network}
\textbf{Why chosen}: Establishes performance ceiling through multiple hidden layers. Fundamentally incompatible with HB 1103's requirement for multiple linear regression models.
\begin{itemize}
    \item 4,049 parameters interacting non-linearly prevent meaningful explanation
    \item HB 1103 specifically requires ``multiple linear regression models" for the algorithm study
    \item Complete lack of interpretability makes appeals impossible
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tiered Implementation Recommendations}

\subsubsection{Tier 1: Primary Replacement Candidates}
Models 1-3 offer viable paths forward with varying trade-offs between innovation and regulatory compliance. Model 3 (Robust Regression) represents the optimal balance, including all consumers while maintaining transparency.

\subsubsection{Tier 2: Conditional Replacement Candidates}
Models 4-6 provide statistical improvements but require careful consideration of equity concerns (Model 4), communication challenges (Model 5), or regulatory hurdles (Model 6).

\subsubsection{Tier 3: Research and Validation Methods}
Models 7-8 offer valuable insights for understanding uncertainty and risk but cannot produce the deterministic allocations required by statute.

\subsubsection{Tier 4: Advanced Methods Requiring Framework Changes}
Models 9-10 demonstrate superior predictive performance. Their implementation requires rule revision and guardrails to minimize black-box effects.

% % \section{Pertinent Regulatory Requirements}
% % %============================================

% % This section presents the statutory and regulatory requirements governing the iBudget algorithm. These provisions establish the legal framework for algorithm development, assessment, and implementation.

% % While no enacted federal laws explicitly mandate algorithmic transparency for government services, the regulatory landscape reveals a complex interplay between proposed legislation, existing legal frameworks, and practical requirements that effectively push toward transparent, interpretable algorithms in government benefit systems. Multiple versions of the Algorithmic Accountability Act have been introduced in Congress since 2019, proposing requirements for impact assessments of high-risk automated decision systems and mandating "transparency, explainability, contestability, and opportunity for recourse" (H.R.6580, 117th Congress, 2022), though none have been enacted. At the federal level, existing legal principles create indirect transparency requirements through constitutional due process protections under the 14th Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act's requirement that agencies provide reasoning for decisions, while federal agencies are already "applying existing civil rights laws to address discrimination in automated systems in housing, employment, and criminal justice" (Brookings, 2024). The White House AI Bill of Rights has highlighted "problems of bias in algorithms and called for transparency" (Brookings, 2024), though this remains policy guidance rather than binding law. In the specific context of Florida's iBudget system, while Chapter 393 of the Florida Statutes defines "algorithm" without mandating transparency, the statutory framework creates de facto transparency requirements through established due process rights (F.S. 393.125), appeals processes requiring explanations, and error correction mechanisms that allow individuals to challenge their assessment results (Rule 65G-4.0214, F.A.C.). The project's Request for Quotes explicitly calls for "alternative algorithms using multiple linear regression" (RFQ 2526-020, 2025) over "black box" approaches like neural networks, reflecting both anticipation of future regulations and practical necessities for a system where individuals must be able to understand and potentially appeal decisions affecting their disability benefits.

The Legislature further finds that clients and their families should have greater flexibility to choose the services that best allow them to live in their community within the limits of an established budget. Therefore, the Legislature intends that the agency, in consultation with the Agency for Health Care Administration, shall manage the service delivery system using individual budgets as the basis for allocating the funds appropriated for the home and community-based services Medicaid waiver program among eligible enrolled clients. The service delivery system that uses individual budgets shall be called the iBudget system''

(emphasis added)
% % \end{quote} 
% % %

% % %
% % \begin{quote}
% % ``The study must also consider whether any waiver services that are not currently funded through the algorithm can be funded through the current algorithm or an alternative algorithm, and the impact of doing so on that algorithm's fit and effectiveness.''

% %     \item The 9.40\% outlier exclusion rate may impair the algorithm's ability to meet Section 393.0662's requirement for ``statistically validated relationships between individual characteristics (variables) and the individual's level of need.''
    
% %     \item The static coefficient structure lacks provisions for adjustment when appropriations increase, as required by the statutory framework.
    
% %     \item The algorithm's limited scope fails to incorporate all waiver services, as HB 1103 requires consideration of ``whether any waiver services that are not currently funded through the algorithm can be funded.''
% % \end{enumerate}

% % These regulatory requirements establish clear standards for algorithm development and assessment, providing the legal foundation for recommendations regarding alternative algorithmic approaches.

% \subsection{Implementation Recommendations}

% Based on comprehensive analysis, we recommend a phased implementation approach beginning with Tier 1 methods. Model 3 (Robust Linear Regression) offers the optimal balance of innovation and compliance, addressing the critical outlier exclusion issue while maintaining full interpretability. For immediate deployment with minimal risk, Model 1 (Re-estimation) provides a baseline improvement. Model 2 (Gamma GLM) should be developed in parallel as a medium-term enhancement.

% Tier 2 methods warrant careful pilot testing, particularly Model 6 (Log-Normal) which shows statistical merit. However, Model 4 (Weighted LS) poses unacceptable equity risks despite efficiency gains. Ridge Regression offers stability benefits but faces explainability challenges that may prove insurmountable.

% Tier 3 methods should be implemented exclusively for research and validation purposes. Both Quantile and Bayesian approaches provide valuable uncertainty quantification for policy analysis and appeals support but cannot generate required deterministic allocations. Their insights should inform risk management and reserve planning without directly determining budgets.

% Tier 4 methods must be categorically rejected for iBudget allocation. Both PCR and neural networks fundamentally violate transparency requirements and would trigger immediate legal challenges. While neural networks achieve superior accuracy, the black-box nature directly contradicts HB 1103's explainability mandate. These methods serve only to establish theoretical performance ceilings.

% \subsection{Conclusion}

% The path forward requires balancing statistical sophistication with regulatory constraints and stakeholder acceptance. Robust Linear Regression emerges as the recommended solution, eliminating problematic outlier exclusions while maintaining the transparency essential for public programs serving vulnerable populations. Success depends on careful implementation with extensive stakeholder engagement, comprehensive training programs, and continuous monitoring for fairness and equity. The transition from Model 5b must prioritize continuity of service while achieving measurable improvements in accuracy, fairness, and inclusivity.
