- Calibration assessment (how well predicted and actual distributions align)

**Classification/Flagging Performance (if applicable):**
- Confusion matrix and prevalence rates for key classes or flags (e.g., "underfunded," "outlier," "manual review needed")
- Precision, recall, and F1-score for each relevant class/threshold
- ROC-AUC or PR-AUC, if relevant
- False positive and false negative rates, with discussion of operational impact

**Reliability and Consistency Measures:**
- Test-retest reliability coefficient (if relevant)
- Internal consistency metrics
